          I'm a fullstack developer who loves building things that work well — from secure authentication flows and clean APIs to minimalist creative interfaces. I use tools like Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, React, and Tailwind to bring projects to life, always with a focus on clean structure and practical design.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m currently exploring frameworks like Next.js (App Router) and authentication libraries like Auth.js, while keeping my backend solid with technologies like Drizzle ORM and Prisma. I'm drawn to industry-standard practices and like understanding *why* things work, not just *how* to build them.
        </p>

          Outside of pure development, I have a soft spot for visual creativity — especially designing t-shirt graphics with clever or emotionally resonant phrases. I enjoy blending tech logic with expressive design to create something unexpected, whether that’s a pun in a vintage typeface or a darkly humorous twist in a vector graphic.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm always learning, always iterating, and always aiming to make things better — one commit (or concept sketch) at a time.
